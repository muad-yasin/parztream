# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A lightweight, self-hosted media server (home Plex alternative). It
scans configured folders for music/video files, stores metadata in
SQLite, and serves a plain HTML/JS web UI so any device on the LAN
can browse and stream files via a browser.

Stack: Python + FastAPI backend, SQLite (stdlib `sqlite3`, no ORM),
static HTML/JS/CSS frontend served directly by FastAPI (no build
step, no framework). Developed on Linux; must also run on Windows.

## Commands

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the dev server (reload on change) -- PARZTREAM_MEDIA_DIRS is now
# optional; without it you land on /setup.html to pick folders via a
# built-in browser instead, and the choice persists in the DB
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Tests
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest                       # whole suite
pytest tests/test_stream.py  # one file
pytest -k out_of_bounds      # by name
```

There is no linter or build step yet.

Tests live in `tests/`, run against tmp-path DB/media dirs via an
autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py` (see below), never your real
config. A couple of `test_scanner.py` cases need real audio and are
skipped automatically when `ffmpeg` isn't on `PATH`.

## Architecture

- `app/config.py` — all configuration is read from environment
  variables here (`PARZTREAM_MEDIA_DIRS`, `PARZTREAM_DB_PATH`,
  `PARZTREAM_CACHE_DIR`/`PARZTREAM_CACHE_MAX_BYTES` for
  `app/transcode.py`'s remux cache and its optional size cap;
  `PARZTREAM_MDNS_ENABLED`/`PARZTREAM_MDNS_HOSTNAME`/`PARZTREAM_PORT`
  for `app/mdns.py` — `PORT` is purely informational, since the app
  has no way to introspect what port `uvicorn` was actually started
  with, it just needs to be kept in sync manually with `--port`).
  Nothing else in the app should read `os.environ` directly. Also
  owns `AUDIO_EXTENSIONS`/`VIDEO_EXTENSIONS` — if you add a new
  extension here, check whether `mimetypes.guess_type()` actually
  knows it (many don't, e.g. `.m4b`); if not, register an override
  with `mimetypes.add_type()` right here too, otherwise streaming
  falls back to `application/octet-stream` and browsers won't play
  it even though the file scans in fine. `MEDIA_DIRS` here is only
  ever a *fallback default* now — see `app/settings.py`.
- `app/settings.py` — mutable, DB-backed settings (currently just
  `media_dirs`), for things a non-technical user configures through
  the web UI (`/setup.html`) instead of environment variables.
  `get_media_dirs()` reads the `settings` table, falling back to
  `config.MEDIA_DIRS` if nothing's been saved there yet; `set_media_dirs()`
  upserts it. This is a *live* lookup, not a module-level constant like
  `config.MEDIA_DIRS` — a folder change through `/setup.html` takes
  effect on the next scan without restarting the process. Anything
  that needs the current media directories should call
  `settings.get_media_dirs()`, never import `config.MEDIA_DIRS`
  directly (that would silently ignore anything saved via setup).
- `app/db.py` — raw `sqlite3` access via a `get_connection()`
  context manager (opens, commits on success, always closes). Two
  tables: `media` and `settings` (a plain key/value store, currently
  just holding `media_dirs` as a JSON-encoded list). No migrations
  system yet — schema changes mean editing `SCHEMA` in this file
  (existing dev DBs need to be deleted and rescanned).
- `app/scanner.py` — walks `settings.get_media_dirs()` via
  `os.walk(..., followlinks=False)` (not `Path.rglob`, deliberately: a
  plain glob would follow symlinks), and explicitly skips any entry
  where `path.is_symlink()` is true.
  Confirmed live before this existed: a symlink named e.g. `song.mp3`
  inside a scanned folder, pointing anywhere on disk, got scanned and
  fully served through the streaming endpoint regardless of what it
  actually pointed to. Don't reintroduce `rglob`/`glob` here without
  re-adding an equivalent symlink check — both the file-level check and
  `followlinks=False` are load-bearing, not redundant (one blocks
  symlinked *files*, the other blocks descending into symlinked
  *directories*). Classifies files as audio/video by extension,
  extracts metadata (`mutagen` for audio tags; a single `ffprobe
  -show_entries format=duration:stream=...` JSON call for video
  duration *and* the first video/audio stream's codec name, stored as
  `video_codec`/`audio_codec` — both degrade gracefully to
  `None`/filename if ffprobe is unavailable; a regex,
  `_parse_show_episode`, against the filename stem for `show_name`/
  `season_number`/`episode_number` — only recognizes the "Show Name
  S01E02" convention, anything else stays ungrouped rather than
  guessing), and upserts into `media` by path. Also deletes DB rows
  for files no longer found on disk. This is the only place
  file-metadata extraction happens. `_extract_metadata` returns a
  dict, not a positional tuple — it kept growing fields (this is its
  3rd extension) and a dict is far less fragile to extend/mock in
  tests than a positional tuple; follow that pattern rather than
  reverting to positional if you add another field.
  Scans run in the background (see below), coordinated by a
  module-level `threading.Lock` plus a `_scan_state` dict
  (`get_scan_status`/`start_scan`/`run_claimed_scan`) — `start_scan()`
  claims the lock synchronously so a second concurrent trigger fails
  fast with 409 instead of racing. This state is in-process memory,
  so the app must always run as a single process/worker (see
  `deploy/`) — multiple workers would each have their own lock and
  could scan concurrently without ever seeing the 409.
- `app/routers/library.py` — CRUD-ish read endpoints over the
  `media` table plus `POST /api/scan` (claims the scan lock, then
  hands the actual scan to FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` — returns
  immediately) and `GET /api/scan/status` for the frontend to poll.
  `GET /api/library` is paginated — it returns
  `{items, total, limit, offset}`, not a bare array; `limit` is
  clamped to `[1, MAX_PAGE_SIZE]`. It also takes an optional
  `show_name` filter, which switches ordering from alphabetical
  `title` to `season_number, episode_number` — episode order only
  makes sense once you've already filtered to one show — and an
  optional `q` search param, a plain `LIKE '%q%'` across
  title/artist/album/show_name (SQLite's `LIKE` is case-insensitive
  for ASCII by default; not worth FTS5 for a personal media library's
  row counts). Not escaping literal `%`/`_` in `q` is a deliberate cut
  — worst case is an overly broad match, never a correctness/security
  issue. `GET
  /api/shows` is a separate, deliberately *un*paginated endpoint
  (grouped/aggregated via `GROUP BY show_name`, and the number of
  distinct shows is inherently much smaller than the episode count —
  pagination would be overkill there). `GET /api/library/{id}/art`
  serves art: `get_cover_art` (audio, uncached) or
  `get_video_thumbnail` (video, cached — see below), 404s if neither
  finds anything. `GET /api/library/{id}/subtitles` serves
  `app/subtitles.py`'s WebVTT conversion, 404s for audio or if there's
  no sidecar file.
- `app/routers/setup.py` — `GET /api/setup/status` (`{"configured": bool}`,
  backed by `settings.is_configured()`), `GET /api/setup/browse?path=`
  (lists subdirectories of `path`, or a platform-appropriate default —
  `Path.home()` on POSIX, first available drive letter on Windows —
  when `path` is omitted; hidden dirs and non-directories are filtered
  out), and `POST /api/setup` (body: `{"media_dirs": [...]}, validates
  each path is a real directory, calls `settings.set_media_dirs()`,
  then triggers a background scan the same way `POST /api/scan` does).
  No path restrictions on what `/browse` can list beyond "must be a
  real directory" — once past auth (if configured), the setup UI can
  see the whole filesystem, same trust boundary as the rest of the
  app; this is a deliberate choice, not an oversight, consistent with
  the "you're the admin" model everywhere else here. Worth remembering:
  `/setup.html`/`/api/setup/*` are reachable with **no auth at all**
  during the specific window where `PARZTREAM_PASSWORD` isn't set yet
  and folders haven't been configured — that's the existing
  no-auth-by-default behavior extended to setup, not a new gap.
- `app/artwork.py` — two independent functions, kept separate rather
  than unified because their cost profiles are opposite. `get_cover_art`
  pulls embedded art out of audio files (ID3 `APIC` for mp3, `covr`
  for MP4-family containers, FLAC `pictures`) via `mutagen`, re-reading
  the file fresh on every request -- cheap (just tag parsing), so
  there's no reason to cache it. `get_video_thumbnail` grabs a real
  frame via `ffmpeg` (seeking to `min(10s, 10% of duration)`, since
  frame 0 is often a black/blank intro) — genuinely expensive compared
  to tag-reading, so unlike cover art it *is* cached, to
  `CACHE_DIR/{id}_thumb.jpg`, sharing the same cache directory and
  pruning as `app/transcode.py`'s remuxed videos. Its whole body runs
  inside `cache.lock_for(str(thumb_path))` for the same reason
  `_get_or_create_remux` does — see `app/cache.py`.
- `app/cache.py` — `prune(protect)`, extracted out of
  `app/transcode.py` once `app/artwork.py`'s video thumbnails became
  a second thing writing into `CACHE_DIR` — both now share one budget
  rather than each tracking their own. Same protect-the-just-created-
  file behavior as before extraction. Tolerant of files disappearing
  mid-run (`FileNotFoundError` on `.stat()` during listing is caught;
  `.unlink()` uses `missing_ok=True`) — two different resources finishing
  and pruning around the same time, each unaware of the other, is a real
  scenario, not a hypothetical one, now that cache creation is locked
  per-resource (see `lock_for` below) rather than globally.
  `lock_for(key)` returns a `threading.Lock` for a given key (a cache
  path, as a string), creating one on first use and never removing it.
  `app/transcode.py`'s `_get_or_create_remux` and `app/artwork.py`'s
  `get_video_thumbnail` each wrap their *entire* check-cache/create-if-
  missing body in `with cache.lock_for(str(output_path)):`. This closes
  a confirmed live bug: without it, concurrent requests for the same
  not-yet-cached resource (e.g. two devices pressing play around the
  same time) each spawned their own `ffmpeg` process racing to write the
  identical output path, and different clients received measurably
  different byte content (different checksums) for what should have
  been one canonical file — not just wasted CPU, an actual correctness
  bug. `tests/test_transcode.py`/`test_artwork.py` have a regression
  test for this using real `threading` (not mocks pretending to be
  concurrent) that fails with `call_count == 8` if the lock is removed —
  keep that test if you ever touch this locking.
- `app/subtitles.py` — looks for a same-stem `.vtt`/`.srt` sidecar
  file next to the video (`find_subtitle_path`; `.vtt` preferred, no
  conversion needed). `.srt` gets converted to WebVTT via a regex
  scoped specifically to `HH:MM:SS,mmm` timestamps (`_srt_to_vtt`) —
  deliberately narrow so it never touches a comma inside actual
  dialogue text. No caching here, unlike thumbnails/remux: it's plain
  text regex substitution, cheap enough to redo on every request.
  Only one subtitle track is supported (no per-language selection) —
  a real scope cut, not an oversight.
- `app/routers/stream.py` — calls `transcode.resolve_playable_path(row)`
  to get the path to actually serve (original or cached remux; a
  `UnsupportedVideoCodec` becomes a `415`), then serves file bytes
  with manual HTTP Range header parsing/`206 Partial Content` support,
  including suffix ranges (`bytes=-500`) and a proper `416` for
  out-of-bounds requests. This is hand-rolled (not `FileResponse`)
  specifically so seeking works in `<video>`/`<audio>` players — that
  includes seeking within a remuxed file, since it's a real cached
  file on disk, not a live stream. Any change here should preserve
  Range support. `Content-Type` is derived via `mimetypes.guess_type()`
  on whichever path actually gets served — don't hardcode it,
  different containers need different MIME types for the browser to
  play them at all. `?original=1` bypasses `resolve_playable_path`
  entirely and serves the source file's raw bytes with
  `Content-Disposition: attachment` (RFC 5987-encoded filename via
  `urllib.parse.quote`, not a naive f-string into the header — avoids
  header injection from unusual filenames). This exists because the
  frontend's "download instead" link for a `415` hits this *same*
  endpoint — without a bypass it would 415 too, since it'd re-run the
  same compatibility check that just failed, leaving no way to get an
  unsupported-codec file's bytes out of parztream at all. Found live
  against a real 29GB HEVC file before this existed: in-browser
  playback correctly blocked, but the "download instead" fallback was
  actually broken.
- `app/transcode.py` — `resolve_playable_path(row)` decides whether a
  video's original file can be played directly (mp4/webm container +
  h264/vp8/vp9/av1 video + aac/mp3/opus/vorbis audio, or no codec info
  yet — see below), or needs a one-time `ffmpeg -c:v copy` remux
  (only re-encoding audio, via `-c:a aac`, if the audio codec itself
  is the problem — e.g. AC3/DTS) cached to `CACHE_DIR/{id}.mp4`. This
  is deliberately *not* full transcoding: video is always copied, never
  re-encoded, so a genuinely incompatible video codec (e.g. HEVC)
  raises `UnsupportedVideoCodec` instead of silently failing or trying
  to fake support. Audio files always direct-play (never routed
  through this). If `video_codec` is `None` (ffprobe unavailable, or
  the row predates this feature and hasn't been rescanned), it falls
  back to direct play rather than guessing wrong. The remux runs
  **synchronously in the request** on a cache miss — no background
  job/polling like scanning has — since it's normally fast (stream
  copy, not re-encode); an audio-only transcode of a long file is the
  one case that can take noticeably longer. The frontend's `playMedia`
  absorbs this by probing with a tiny ranged request before handing
  the URL to `<video>`/`<audio>`, so the cache is already warm by the
  time real playback starts. Calls `cache.prune()` right after writing
  a new file (see `app/cache.py`) — an evicted file isn't a loss, just
  a cache miss on next play (cheap to re-derive, unlike the original
  scan metadata).
- `app/auth.py` — `SessionAuthMiddleware`, a pure ASGI middleware (not
  `BaseHTTPMiddleware`, which buffers `StreamingResponse` bodies —
  that would hurt streaming large files). Replaced `BasicAuthMiddleware`
  (HTTP Basic Auth, which gave every visitor the browser's native,
  unbranded credential popup) with a signed session cookie set by a
  real login page — non-technical-user UX was the whole motivation, see
  git history around "real login page" for the fuller reasoning.
  Gates the entire app uniformly except `PUBLIC_PATHS`
  (`/login.html`, `/api/login` — deliberately minimal; `login.html` is
  fully self-contained with inline CSS/JS specifically so nothing else
  needs to be added here). No-ops entirely if `PARZTREAM_PASSWORD`
  isn't set, same as before. Distinguishes a real browser navigation
  from a `fetch()`/`<img>`/`<video>` request via the `Accept` header
  (`text/html` → `302` redirect to `/login.html?next=<original path>`;
  anything else → `401` JSON) — don't "simplify" this to always redirect
  or always 401, both branches are load-bearing: a JS `fetch()` getting
  an HTML redirect body where it expects JSON would break silently, and
  a top-level page load getting a bare `401` would show raw JSON
  instead of the login page.
  Sessions are itsdangerous-signed cookies (`URLSafeTimedSerializer`,
  keyed by `config.SECRET_KEY`) carrying no real payload beyond a fixed
  marker string + timestamp — verified via signature + `SESSION_MAX_AGE`
  (90 days), not looked up against any server-side store. That means
  logout (`app/routers/login.py`) only works by telling the *client* to
  stop sending the cookie (`Response.delete_cookie`) — there's no
  revocation list, so a copied cookie value stays valid until it
  expires on its own regardless of logout, and changing
  `PARZTREAM_PASSWORD` does **not** invalidate already-issued sessions
  (only rotating `SECRET_KEY` does, since that's what sessions are
  signed against, not the password). This is a known, accepted
  trade-off for a stateless design, not an oversight — document it if
  you touch this, don't silently "fix" it into a stateful store without
  discussing the trade-off first.
  No `Secure` flag on the cookie: parztream runs over plain HTTP by
  design (see README), and a `Secure` cookie is never sent back at all
  over a non-HTTPS connection — setting it would silently break every
  login.
- `app/routers/login.py` — `POST /api/login` (checks
  `auth.check_credentials`, sets the session cookie), `POST /api/logout`
  (clears it). References `auth.AUTH_PASSWORD`/`auth.AUTH_USERNAME` via
  the `auth` module object (`from .. import auth`, then `auth.AUTH_PASSWORD`
  at call time) rather than `from ..auth import AUTH_PASSWORD` — the
  latter would bind its own independent copy at import time that tests
  monkeypatching `auth.AUTH_PASSWORD` wouldn't reach. Same "quirk" as
  `config.py`'s other consumers, documented further down.
- `app/network.py` — `get_local_ip()`, the classic "connect a UDP
  socket to an external address and read what local address the OS
  picked" trick for guessing this machine's LAN-facing IP. UDP
  `connect()` never actually sends a packet (connectionless), so this
  doesn't need real connectivity to work, just a configured route.
- `app/mdns.py` — advertises `http://<MDNS_HOSTNAME>.local:<PORT>/`
  over mDNS via the `zeroconf` package, so LAN devices that support it
  can reach the server without knowing its IP (see README's "Finding
  the server" for the real per-platform support picture — it's
  genuinely inconsistent on Windows/Android, not just theoretically).
  **`start_mdns()` spins up a background `threading.Thread` rather
  than registering inline — this is load-bearing, not a style choice.**
  Confirmed live: calling `zeroconf`'s sync `register_service()`
  directly from inside the FastAPI lifespan reliably raises
  `zeroconf._exceptions.EventLoopBlocked`, because zeroconf's sync API
  schedules work on its own internal event loop via
  `run_coroutine_threadsafe` and waits for it, and doing that from a
  thread that's already running *another* event loop (uvicorn's, which
  the lifespan runs on) contends and times out. A plain background
  thread sidesteps it entirely. If you ever refactor this, re-verify
  against a real running server (`tests/test_mdns.py`'s mocked tests
  wouldn't have caught this — only the real round-trip test would, and
  only if it were run against a genuinely async-hosted app; `tests/`
  uses `TestClient`, which never triggered this because it runs
  its own event loop differently than uvicorn does under `--reload`).
  Registration failure of any kind is always non-fatal — logs a
  warning, never raises — the server works fine by IP either way.
  `stop_mdns()` unregisters + closes on app shutdown; also safe to
  call if `start_mdns()` never successfully registered.
- `app/main.py` — wires routers and mounts `static/` at `/`. Route
  registration order matters: API routers are included *before* the
  `StaticFiles` mount, since the static mount is a catch-all at `/`.
  `SessionAuthMiddleware` is added at app level so it covers everything
  behind it. Explicitly attaches a `StreamHandler` to the `"parztream"`
  logger and sets `propagate = False` — without an actual handler,
  Python's logging module only surfaces `WARNING`+ via its built-in
  fallback ("handler of last resort"), regardless of what level is set
  on the logger itself. Confirmed live: the `PARZTREAM_PASSWORD` unset
  warning showed up in the console fine, but `app/mdns.py`'s
  successful-registration `info()` log line silently didn't, which
  looked exactly like mDNS had failed even though it hadn't. If you
  add more `logger.info()` calls elsewhere expecting them to be
  visible, they'll work now that this is fixed — don't rediscover this
  the hard way.
- `static/` — plain JS, no bundler. `app.js` fetches `/api/library`
  (with `limit`/`offset`/`q`, tracked in module-level `offset`/search-
  input state, reset to 0 on filter change, show-select change,
  search input, or after a scan), renders each row as `<li><button
  class="row-btn">...` — a real `<button>`, not a click handler on the
  `<li>` (see "Accessibility" below for why that distinction matters)
  — with a lazy-loaded, `alt=""` (decorative — the adjacent text label
  already names the item) `<img src="/api/library/{id}/art">` (hidden
  via `onerror` if 404), prefixed with `S{season}E{episode}` when
  `show_name` is set, or an "empty" message (different text for "no
  media scanned yet" vs. "no search results") when the list is empty.
  The search `<input>` is debounced 300ms (`searchDebounceTimer`) so
  it doesn't fire a request per keystroke. The shows `<select>` is
  repopulated from `GET /api/shows` on load and after each scan.
  `playMedia` probes
  `/api/stream/{id}` with a tiny `Range: bytes=0-1` request first —
  this both warms the transcode cache before real playback starts and
  lets a `415` (unsupported video codec) show a "download instead"
  message (link uses `?original=1`, *not* the bare stream URL — see
  `app/routers/stream.py`) rather than a silent `<video>` failure —
  before pointing an `<audio>`/`<video>` element at the same URL,
  plus a `<track>` for
  video pointed at `/api/library/{id}/subtitles` (no pre-check needed
  here — a 404 on a `<track src>` just gets ignored by the browser,
  unlike a `<video src>` 415). Also polls `/api/scan/status` after
  triggering a scan (the trigger endpoint returns immediately, it
  doesn't wait for the scan to finish). `init()` checks
  `GET /api/setup/status` before anything else and redirects to
  `/setup.html` if unconfigured — every other function in this file
  assumes at least one media dir already exists, so don't reorder this
  check after the rest of startup.
  `setup.html`/`setup.js` are a self-contained folder-browser page
  (separate from `index.html`, not a view inside the main SPA-ish
  page) — click a name in `#folder-list` to descend, "Add this folder"
  to select the *currently browsed* path (these are different actions:
  clicking navigates, the button selects), remove selected folders
  individually, "Save & start scanning" `POST`s to `/api/setup` and
  redirects to `/` on success. Deliberately no path-typing fallback —
  browse-only, since the whole point is not requiring the user to know
  an exact filesystem path.
  `login.html` is standalone, not a view inside `index.html` — inline
  `<style>`/`<script>`, no dependency on `style.css`/`app.js`, so it
  never needs to be in `auth.PUBLIC_PATHS` beyond itself. Password-only
  form (no username field) — `AUTH_USERNAME` is applied server-side
  without the user ever entering it, since it's almost never changed
  from the default and asking for it adds a confusing "wait, what's my
  username?" moment for the non-technical audience this is aimed at.
  Reads `?next=` from its own URL to return you to whatever page
  triggered the redirect, but only if it's a relative path
  (`next.startsWith("/")`) — guards against an open-redirect via a
  crafted link with `?next=https://evil.example`. The header's
  "Log out" button `POST`s `/api/logout` then sends you to
  `/login.html` directly.

  **Accessibility conventions, apply these to any new interactive UI:**
  - Any clickable row/list item must be a real `<button>` wrapping the
    row's content (class `row-btn`, styled in `style.css` to look like
    a plain row — no default button chrome), never a `click` handler
    on a non-interactive element like `<li>`/`<div>`. This is a
    confirmed-real fix, not theoretical: before this, list rows were
    entirely unreachable by keyboard.
  - Icon-only controls (no visible text, e.g. `setup.html`'s `⬆` up
    button) need an explicit `aria-label` — a `title` attribute alone
    isn't reliably exposed to screen readers and isn't visible until
    hover for sighted users either.
  - Any `<input>`/`<select>` needs a real `<label>`, even if it's
    visually hidden via the `.sr-only` class (defined in `style.css`
    and, since `login.html` doesn't link that stylesheet, duplicated
    inline there too) — a placeholder is not an accessible-name
    substitute, and disappears once the user starts typing anyway.
  - Content that changes without a page navigation (scan status,
    search result counts, player state) should call `app.js`'s
    `announce(message)` helper, which writes into the hidden
    `#status-announcer` (`aria-live="polite"`) — otherwise screen
    reader users get no feedback that anything happened. `setup.html`
    has its own local live regions instead (`#current-path` as
    `aria-live="polite"`, `#setup-error` as `role="alert"`) since it
    doesn't share `app.js`.
  - `<img>` elements need an explicit `alt` — `alt=""` when the image
    is purely decorative/redundant with adjacent text (e.g. the
    library thumbnails, since the title label right next to them
    already identifies the item), a real description otherwise. Never
    leave `alt` unset.
  - Color contrast in the existing dark palette (`#14161a`/`#1e2127`/
    `#23262c` backgrounds, `#e6e6e6`/`#9aa0aa` text, `#7aa2f7` links,
    `#f78c8c` errors) was verified by calculating actual WCAG contrast
    ratios, not eyeballed — all pass AA, most pass AAA. If you add a
    new color, check it the same way rather than assuming a dark theme
    is automatically fine.
  - None of this was tested with a real screen reader or an automated
    tool (axe-core, Lighthouse) — no browser automation was available
    in the environment this was built in. It's built correct per the
    relevant WCAG success criteria and carefully code-reviewed, that's
    a different (weaker) claim than "verified" — don't oversell it as
    tested if you're asked about it later.
- `deploy/` — templates for running as a persistent background
  service (systemd unit + env-file template for Linux, a batch
  script + env-file template for Windows), documented in the
  README's "Running as a service" section. Not installed/enabled
  anywhere by default — these are files to copy onto a target
  machine, not something the app or its tests touch. Real env files
  with actual passwords belong outside the repo (`/etc/parztream/`
  or `C:\ProgramData\parztream\`), never committed — only the
  `.example` templates live in `deploy/`.

Test isolation relies on a quirk worth knowing: `config.py` reads env
vars into module-level constants at import time, and `db.py`/
`auth.py`/etc. import those by name (`from .config import DB_PATH`,
etc.), so patching env vars after startup does nothing.
`tests/conftest.py` instead monkeypatches the *consuming* module's
attribute directly (e.g. `monkeypatch.setattr(db, "DB_PATH", ...)`,
`monkeypatch.setattr(config, "MEDIA_DIRS", ...)`) — that works because
each function looks up the name in its own module's globals at call
time. `CACHE_DIR` in particular is imported separately by *three*
modules (`transcode.py`, `artwork.py`, `cache.py`), all of which need
patching to the same tmp path for a test to see one consistent cache
dir — `isolated_app_state` does all three.

This same quirk is why `app/routers/login.py` deliberately imports
`from .. import auth` and writes `auth.AUTH_PASSWORD` instead of
`from ..auth import AUTH_PASSWORD` — the latter binds its own
independent copy at import time, which `monkeypatch.setattr(auth,
"AUTH_PASSWORD", ...)` in tests would never reach. When a module needs
a value another module already imported from `config` (rather than
importing straight from `config` itself), prefer referencing the
other module's attribute at call time over re-importing from `config`
directly — keeps there being one obvious place tests need to patch.
`app/mdns.py` follows the same rule from the start (`from . import
config`, then `config.MDNS_ENABLED`/etc. throughout) rather than
`from .config import MDNS_ENABLED` — same reasoning, applied
proactively rather than fixed after the fact.

If you add a new config value, follow the same pattern rather than
trying to override the environment mid-test.

## Conventions

- Cross-platform paths: use `pathlib.Path` and `os.pathsep`
  everywhere (not hardcoded `:`/`;`) since Windows support is a
  target, not just Linux.
- Keep metadata extraction failures non-fatal — a single unreadable
  or corrupt media file should not abort the whole scan, and one bad
  tag field (e.g. malformed title) shouldn't discard sibling fields
  (e.g. duration) — see the per-field try/except in
  `_extract_metadata`/`_first_tag`.
- Auth is intentionally minimal (single shared password, no
  per-user accounts) — this is a home-LAN tool, not multi-tenant.
